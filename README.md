# Genshin-Wish-Predictor
A Genshin Impact 5 Star Predictor and Primogem Calculator which outputs the odds of getting N amounts of 5 stars or primogem/Intertwined Fate left

# NOTE
Someone fix my CSS, I dont want to do that

# Things to Keep in mind! (Dev Notes)
For this to work, we must be able to determine what the:
- Current Pity = To Be Input by the User
- Current Primogem Count = To Be Input by the User
- Current Intertwined Fate Count = To Be Input by the User
- Current Stardust + Starglitter count
- Wishing date (Can also be days left, maybe?)

- Events = 420 Average per Event + 3 Events per Patch
- Main Event = Assuming 720 Primogems per Patch

Other things that can influence the outcome are:
- Current Abyss Stars (Floors 9 - 12) = 150 Primogems per floor.
- Welkin ownership (30 days per Welkin) (Will only take 1 Welkin Moon)
- Battlepass ownership = 680 Primogems + 4 Fates (per patch) 

Fixed rewards + content/events:
- Maintenance = 600 Primogems (per patch)
- Livestreams = 300 primogems (per patch)
- Character Trials = 20 Primogems per Character + 4 Characters per update.
- Daily Comission Rewards = 60 Primogems per day;
- If 50/50 is lost, then + 10 Starglitter

Miscellaneous (ADD LATER):
- Web Events
- Hoyolab

# Conversions and Info
- 160 Primogemmss = 1 Intertwined Fate
- 5 Starglitter = 1 Intertwined Fate
- 75 Stardust = 1 Intertwined Fate (Max 5 per month (30 Days))

- 1 3-Star Weapon = 15 Stardust (Needs 5 3-Star Wishes for 1 Converted IF)
- 1 4-Star Weapon = 2 Starglitter (Needs 3 wishes [Excess 1 Starglitter] for 1 Converted IF) (In every )

- In every 10 Wishes there is a 4-Star Character/Weapon Guaranteed (Assume all chracters return 2 Starglitter)
- In every 75 Wishes there is a chance for a 5 Star.
- In every 90 Wishes there is a guarnteed 5 Star.
- In every 50/50 Loss, the next one is guaranteed.  (Concept)
- Assuming in every 5th 50/50, it loses.  (Concept)
- Each patch lasts up to 42 days.
- Maintenance and Livestreams will only count every (patch or 42 days), if below 42 days then do not include.
